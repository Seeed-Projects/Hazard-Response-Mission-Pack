### Description:

![the pack](./img/case.jpg)

Hazard Response Mission Pack is an open-source AIoT solution designed for efficient management and mitigation of hazard scenarios. This compact system integrates a range of technologies, from sensor networks to edge computing, enabling effective remote sensing, data transmission, processing, inference, and analysis.

This is not a market-ready product; rather, it represents a collaborative effort between Seeed and a global community of practitioners dedicated to leveraging technology for real-world challenges. We invite contributions from individuals and organizations alike to  explore the limitless potential of “tech for hazard response.”
